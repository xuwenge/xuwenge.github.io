            <h1>Design Guidelines for Adding Virtual Spectator Audience in Virtual Reality Games <a
                    href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1079132/full">

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enabling spectator feedback as a main priority</strong>
                    <p>
                        Exergame designers should include some type of spectator
                        support and encouraging messages whenever players are making
                        good progress, e.g., (1) when their performance has
                        achieved a certain level, (2) when their performance has resulted in good outcomes,
                        and (3) when their performance has prevented
                        the opponent from performing well.</p>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Adding larger spectator audience</strong>
                    <p>
                        Here we list examples of how the spectator NPCs can be added to the
                        games based on the degree of locomotion the player
                        has in VR:
                    <ul>
                        <li>(1) <strong>Low</strong>: in exergames that the player mostly remains at
                            the same location [e.g., VirusBoxing, Beat Saber4, Hot Squat,
                            spectators/supporters can be added behind the player, alongside the
                            objects’ flying area, or placed at a higher location where the game
                            objects are initialized.</li>
                        <li>(2) <strong>Medium</strong>: in exergames where players only
                            need to move in a limited in-game distance (Eleven Table Tennis
                            VR), spectators can be added around the users but with a small
                            distance. A good example is the Creed: Rise to Glory.</li>
                        <li>
                            (3) <strong>High</strong>:
                            in exergames where players need to move their in-game position
                            on a large scale (e.g., VR cycling games), the
                            spectator could be placed alongside the playing or track field (e.g.,
                            placing the spectators next to the street for VR cycling games).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <h1>Design Guidelines for Adding Co-Located non-VR users in VR Games <a
                    href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1079132/full">
                    1</a> </h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> Representing Co-located Non-VR Observers on Head-Mounted Display</strong>
                    <p>
                        Our study suggests that VR HMD users prefer real visual representations of observers, allowing
                        them to see real-time reactions and movements, enhancing copresence and
                        communication. We recommend displaying/passthrough only the
                        co-located observer or the entire real environment on HMDs. Passthrough only the
                        co-located
                        observer maintains more of the virtual environment and simulates observers
                        entering the virtual space, while Passthrough the entire real environment merges virtual and
                        real environments for a comprehensive real-world view. Displaying observers in a
                        window is discouraged due to its unnatural integration, which reduces the sense of shared
                        space.</p>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Representing Co-located Non-VR Observers on 2D Screens (e.g., TV, laptop, monitor)</strong>
                    <p>
                        Unlike VR HMD users, co-located non-vr observers watching on 2D screens preferred either a
                        realistic representation
                        or a virtual avatar, influenced by their personalities. We recommend offering both options to
                        accommodate different needs. Observers who preferred a realistic image
                        felt it enhanced their participation and immersion. For this, we suggest using passthrough only
                        observer technique to show only
                        the observer, as it best supports their sense of entering the virtual world. Passthrough entire
                        environment is less
                        necessary for observers already seeing the real environment, and Displaying observers in a
                        window is not recommended due to its unnatural integration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those who preferred a virtual avatar, the benefits included
                        reducing awkwardness and blending naturally with the virtual environment. We recommend using
                        avatars consistent with the virtual world’s style and suggest two design enhancements: (1) offer
                        customizable models for personalized avatars, and (2) use motion
                        capture to align avatar movements with the observer’s actions.

            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Include an audience and feedback that reacts
                        to players’ movements in VR exergames</strong>
                    <p>
                        Based on our fndings, including an audience (even composed of generic NPCs) and its
                        feedback reacting to the players’ movements can improve the performance and enhance the gameplay
                        experience for elderly players. We suggest including an audience and providing positive feedback
                        whenever the elderly players are making good progress, the term "good progress" can be varied
                        across games, please define this based on the game you are designing. In addition, more NPC
                        models
                        and a diverse range of visual and audio feedback are needed.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Gesture customization or adaptive exertion level
                        for older adult users</strong>
                    <p>When all movements can achieve the desired exertion of the exergame:
                        (1) providing the players with a list of movements and enabling them to select their preferred
                        gestures, or (2) allowing the players to customize the gestures; both approaches could lead to
                        a better and more personalized experience. </p>

                    <p>When some movements cannot achieve the desired
                        exertion level but are necessary to help players reach a certain exertion level, a possible
                        approach is to apply an adaptive exertion level for each participant based on each individual’s
                        physical ability level, exercise demands, and performance in the game.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>More acceptable VR exergames for Chinese older adults.</strong>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>As Perceived Usefulness had a positive effect on
                                Chinese older adults’ intention towards VR exergames,
                                VR game desginers of these games should (1) ensure a game
                                is sufficient to provide health benefits, and (2) highlight the health benefits people
                                could obtain and how effective of it.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Use natural and simple motions (e.g., punching, slicing,
                                dancing) for VR exergames as these motions are easy to
                                use–Perceived Ease of Use is a positive predictor of
                                Chinese older adults’ intention to use VR exergames.
                                No additional tutorials are needed when the game only uses easy-to learn and natural
                                motions.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>VR exergame producers should provide various in-game
                                achievements to encourage further gameplay. One way
                                to achieve this is to use a badge system.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>VR exergames should enable social interaction within
                                these games and encourage older adults to play together
                                in groups or at least with another friend.
                                Studies suggest that social interaction could help older
                                adults exchange tips for better performance and, as
                                such, could make them more engaged in a game.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Consideration should be given to the demographics of
                                the population. e.g., if it's Chinese older adults, dancing games should
                                involve some type of Chinese style dances. Chinese
                                songs can also be provided in rhythmic-based and dancing games.
                                Multiplayer features should be supported
                                since the Chinese elderly are quite social and prefer to
                                play with their peers. </p>
                        </li>
