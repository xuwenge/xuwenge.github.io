                <p>
                    I'm a lecturer in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) based within the <a href="https://www.bcu.ac.uk/research/human-computer-interaction"> Human-Computeer Interaction Research Centre </a>, 
                    Birmingham City University. My university profile can be found <a
                        href="https://www.bcu.ac.uk/digital-technology/about-us/our-expertise/our-staff/wenge-xu">here</a>
                    page.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> I obtained my PhD degree in 2021 from University of Liverpool, where I was supervised by Prof Hai-Ning Liang.
                    
                    Currently, my main research interests are: HCI, Extended Reality, Games (see my <a
                        href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RRAHfSYAAAAJ&amp;hl" target="_blank">Google
                        Scholar</a>).
                    My research mainly focuses on (1) understanding human factors of people interacting with emerging
                    technologies and, (2) designing interaction for people interact with emerging devices.</p>

                    <br>
                <p>
                    Current projects are: (1) Inclusive eHMI for d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing people and (2) Inclusive VR games for d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing people.
